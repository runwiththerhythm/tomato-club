      Joining the club gives you access to our Seed Library, seasonal seed
      offers by post, and a small, supportive community of UK growers.

    <p class="text-sm md:text-base max-w-3xl text-base-content/80">
      Start with the <strong>Free Gardener</strong> tier for online resources,

        The club is in its early “seedling” phase. Features like member
        dashboards, online payments, and automated seed allocations will be
        added gradually. For now, we’re focusing on getting the basics right:
        good varieties, clear communication, and a welcoming community.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm opacity-80">
        Paid tiers, seed drops, and supporter perks are part of our roadmap.
        In the meantime, joining as a <strong>Free Gardener</strong> helps us
        grow the club and lets you be first to hear when new features go live.
