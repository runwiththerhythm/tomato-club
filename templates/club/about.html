      About the Heritage Tomato Club
    </h1>
    <p class="text-base md:text-lg max-w-3xl">
      The Heritage Tomato Club is a small, friendly, UK-focused community
      dedicated to preserving flavourful, rare, and historic tomato varieties.
      We support growers of all levels — whether you have a greenhouse, an
      allotment, or just a sunny kitchen windowsill.

      <h2 class="card-title text-2xl">Our mission</h2>
      <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">
        Supermarket tomatoes prioritise transport, yield, and uniformity —
        but they’ve lost much of the flavour and diversity that once existed
        in kitchen gardens across the UK and beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to keep heritage and heirloom tomatoes in active
        cultivation by sharing seeds, knowledge, and stories. Each saved seed
        keeps a piece of living history alive.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm opacity-75">
        As a community-led project, we grow slowly and intentionally —
        improving the club with the help, feedback, and contributions of our
        members.

          Heritage tomatoes often come with tales — who saved them, where
          they travelled, and why they were loved. We try to preserve those
          stories alongside the seeds.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">How the club works</h2>
    <p class="text-base max-w-3xl">
      Membership gives you access to the Seed Library, seasonal seed offers,
      and club-only updates. We don’t aim to be a large social network —
      our focus is on a warm, helpful, small-scale community.
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-base">
      <li>Choose a membership tier based on your growing interest</li>
      <li>Receive heritage varieties suited to UK conditions</li>
      <li>Grow, save seed, and share your results with the club</li>
      <li>Help keep rare tomato lines in active circulation</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-sm opacity-80 max-w-2xl">
      In time, we’ll expand the Seed Library, release growing guides, and
      support members in saving, drying, and storing seed properly.
