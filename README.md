## Introduction

Gig Vault is a personal live music diary application that helps fans track, organise, and remember their concert experiences. Users can log gigs with band lineups, venues, dates, photos, and videos and create an archive of their concert journey. Unlike generic apps, Gig Vault is designed specifically for concerts and festivals, making it easier to preserve memories and reflect on the role of live music in personal culture.

Designed to appeal to festival goers who want to remember all the bands they've seen when and where over the years.

## UX

### The 5 Planes of UX

#### 1. Strategy

**Purpose**
- Provide music fans with a dedicated tool to log, organize, and relive their live music experiences.
- Offer users an intuitive platform to browse their personal gig history, including bands, venues, images, and media links.
- Support users with features like statistics, reminders, and media integration to make their gig history engaging and meaningful.

**Primary User Needs**
- Users need a simple way to record new gigs (band, venue, date, notes, images, videos).
- Users need the ability to browse past gigs quickly, either by date, band, or venue.
- Users need a secure, private space where their data and memories are preserved.
- Users want to see patterns and highlights (e.g, most seen bands, attended festivals, anniversary reminders).

**Business Goals**
- Deliver a unique niche platform focusing specifically on live music memories
- Encourage long-term engagement by giving users reasons to revisit (e.g., stats, reminders, multimedia playback).
- Demonstrate a well-structured, user-centered Django web application for academic and portfolio purposes.

#### 2. Scope

**[Features](#features)** (see below)

**Content Requirements**
- Gig management (create, update, delete).
- Band management (headliners and support artists).
- Venue management (integrated with Mapbox Search JS).
- Image upload and cover image selection (via Cloudinary).
- YouTube video linking and auto-search.
- Stats and insights (total gigs, most-seen band, “On This Day”).
- User authentication (signup, login, logout).
- Dashboard view with upcoming and attended gigs.
- Error handling pages (e.g., 404, 500).

#### 3. Structure

**Information Architecture**
- **Navigation Menu**:
  - Links to Home, Dashboard, My Gigs, Add Gig, Logout..
- **Hierarchy**:
  - Dashboard and “My Gigs” provide a clear overview of past and upcoming gigs.
  - Gig detail pages highlight band, venue, and media.
  - Create/Edit forms use autocomplete for bands/venues, with clear CTAs for “add new”.

**User Flow**
1. Guest user visits Landing Page → learns about Gig Vault, sees a call-to-action to sign up or log in.
2. User signs up or logs in → gains access to Dashboard and gig tools.
3. User creates a gig entry → fills band, venue, date, adds images/videos.
4. User browses past gigs or adds new ones over time → personal archive grows into a complete music history.
5. User explores stats → checks most-seen bands etc.

#### 4. Skeleton

**[Wireframes](#wireframes)** (see below)

#### 5. Surface

**Visual Design Elements**
- **[Colours](#colour-scheme)** (see below)
- **[Typography](#typography)** (see below)

### Colour Scheme

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co) to finalise my color palette.

![screenshot](documentation/coolors.png)

The Gig Vault palette was chosen to reflect the energy and atmosphere of live music, especially the lighting set you experience at concerts and festivals.

Fiery Orange (#FF4C1A) & Golden Yellow (#FFDD33)
Inspired by stage lights, pyrotechnics, and sunset skies at outdoor gigs. These warm tones bring immediacy and excitement to buttons and call-to-action elements.

Electric Purple (#8E4CD9) & Magenta Pink (#C2188D)
Drawn from the neon floods, strobes and lasers. These cooler, high-energy colours balance the warm tones and give a sense of atmosphere and nightlife.

Light Mode Foundations (#FAF9F6 background, #1A1A1A text)
Chosen for readability and a clean diary-like feel, so users can comfortably browse and log gigs in daylight settings.

Dark Mode Foundations (#1E1229 deep purple background, #F5F3FA text)
Inspired by the low-light conditions of concert venues, with a subtle purple tint to feel immersive but easy on the eyes. This mode echoes the ambience of being in the crowd under stage lighting.

By combining these brights with neutral light and dark foundations, Gig Vault maintains accessibility (AA contrast) while also capturing the vibrant, high-contrast lighting environment of live shows.

### Typography

- [Modern Thrash](https://thebrandedquotes.sellfy.store/p/modern-thrash-font/) was used for the primary headers and titles. This font evokes heavy metal artwork, festival branding and live posters, with sharp edges and a distorted aesthetic that ties directly into the live music scene and the energy it creates.
- System ui font has been used for the body to keep it readable and clear on all devices.

## Database Design

### Data Model

Gig Vault uses a relational schema built in PostgreSQL with models representing users, gigs, bands, venues, images, videos and genres.

![screenshot](documentation/erd.png)

 [`Mermaid flowchart`](https://mermaid.live). 
I have used `Mermaid` to generate an ERD of my project.

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://www.github.com/runwiththerhythm/gig_vault/projects) served as an Agile management tool for this project. Through it, User Stories, issues/bugs and tasks were planned, then subsequently tracked on a regular basis using the Kanban project board.

![screenshot](documentation/gh-projects.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://www.github.com/runwiththerhythm/gig_vault/issues) served as an another Agile tool. There, I managed my User Stories and Milestone tasks and tracked any issues/bugs.

## Testing

> [!NOTE]  
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://gig-vault-2fe6800a7bea.herokuapp.com).

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), then finally, click **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables to match your private `env.py` file.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL` | user-inserts-own-cloudinary-url |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user-inserts-own-postgres-database-url |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | any-random-secret-key |

Heroku needs some additional files in order to deploy properly.

- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
- [Procfile](Procfile)
- [.python-version](.python-version)

You can install this project's **[requirements.txt](requirements.txt)** (*where applicable*) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **[Procfile](Procfile)** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace `app_name` with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where `settings.py` is located*

The **[.python-version](.python-version)** file tells Heroku the specific version of Python to use when running your application.

- `3.12` (or similar)

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either (*recommended*):

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (*replace `app_name` with your app name*)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Cloudinary API

This project uses the [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com) to store media assets online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

To obtain your own Cloudinary API key, create an account and log in.

- For "Primary Interest", you can choose **Programmable Media for image and video API**.
- *Optional*: edit your assigned cloud name to something more memorable.
- On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you can copy your **API Environment Variable**.
- Be sure to remove the leading `CLOUDINARY_URL=` as part of the API **value**; this is the **key**.
    - `cloudinary://123456789012345:AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStuVwXyZa@1a2b3c4d5)`
- This will go into your own `env.py` file, and Heroku Config Vars, using the **key** of `CLOUDINARY_URL`.

### PostgreSQL

This project uses a [Code Institute PostgreSQL Database](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net) for the Relational Database with Django.

> [!CAUTION]
> - PostgreSQL databases by Code Institute are only available to CI Students.
> - You must acquire your own PostgreSQL database through some other method if you plan to clone/fork this repository.
> - Code Institute students are allowed a maximum of 8 databases.
> - Databases are subject to deletion after 18 months.

To obtain my own Postgres Database from Code Institute, I followed these steps:

- Submitted my email address to the CI PostgreSQL Database link above.
- An email was sent to me with my new Postgres Database.
- The Database connection string will resemble something like this:
    - `postgres://<db_username>:<db_password>@<db_host_url>/<db_name>`
- You can use the above URL with Django; simply paste it into your `env.py` file and Heroku Config Vars as `DATABASE_URL`.

### WhiteNoise

This project uses the [WhiteNoise](https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to aid with static files temporarily hosted on the live Heroku site.

To include WhiteNoise in your own projects:

- Install the latest WhiteNoise package:
    - `pip install whitenoise`
- Update the `requirements.txt` file with the newly installed package:
    - `pip freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- Edit your `settings.py` file and add WhiteNoise to the `MIDDLEWARE` list, above all other middleware (apart from Django’s "SecurityMiddleware"):

```python
# settings.py

MIDDLEWARE = [
    'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
    'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
    # any additional middleware
]
```


### Local Development

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level, and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "any-random-secret-key")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user-inserts-own-postgres-database-url")
os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "user-inserts-own-cloudinary-url")  # only if using Cloudinary

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` (*Windows/Linux*) or `⌘+C` (*Mac*)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry-run` then `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate --plan` then `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (*if applicable*): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (*repeat for each file*)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

If you'd like to backup your database models, use the following command for each model you'd like to create a fixture for:

- `python3 manage.py dumpdata your-model > your-model.json`
- *repeat this action for each model you wish to backup*
- **NOTE**: You should never make a backup of the default *admin* or *users* data with confidential information.
